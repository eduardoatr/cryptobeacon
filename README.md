Beacon is a simple command-line interface tool for cryptocurrency alerts directly into your desktop. It uses the free [CoinGecko API](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api/documentation) to obtain the current prices, sending desktop notification when alarm price targets are reached. The application is built in [Python](https://www.python.org/), with the help of [Typer](https://github.com/tiangolo/typer) and [Rich](https://github.com/Textualize/rich).

```

Confirm the addition using the **show** command:

```Bash
beacon show
```

Next, you need to add a price target for the **alarm**:

```Bash
beacon alarm add bitcoin 21000
```

Finally, **run** the application:
